## Why VueRequest

In past projects, we were often troubled by the repetitive implementation of loading state management, request throttling and debouncing, API data caching, pagination, etc. Every time we started a new project, we had to handle these issues manually, which was a repetitive task that also required ensuring team consistency.

VueRequest is designed to provide developers with a convenient and fast way to manage API states. By simply configuring it, you can eliminate the tedious tasks and focus on core development.

## Install

You can install VueRequest with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/), or a `<script>` via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/)

### NPM

```sh
npm install vue-request
# or
yarn add vue-request
# or
pnpm install vue-request
```

### CDN

> For production environments, we recommend linking to a specific version and build file to avoid unexpected breaking changes caused by new versions.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-request/dist/vue-request.min.js"></script>
```

Once you add it to your page, you can access our exported methods in `window.VueRequest`.

## Usage

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="loading">loading...</div>
    <div v-if="error">failed to fetch</div>
    <div v-if="data">Hey! {{ data }}</div>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const { data, loading, error } = useRequest(service);
</script>
```

In this example, `useRequest` receives a `service` function. `service` is an asynchronous request function, which means you can use **axios** to retrieve data and return a **Promise**. More specific details can be found in the [documentation](https://www.attojs.com/guide/documentation/dataFetching.html).

The `useRequest` function also returns three values: `data`, `loading`, and `error`. While the request is still in progress, `data` will be set to `undefined` and `loading` will be `true`. Once the request is completed, `data` and `error` will be set based on the result, and the page will be rendered accordingly. This is because `data`, `loading`, and `error` are [Reactivity(Refs)](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html) in Vue, and their values will be updated based on the request status and result.

## Some of the coolest features:

VueRequest provides many features, such as error retry, caching, pagination, throttling, debouncing, and more. Here are two particularly cool features:

### 1.Refresh On Focus

Sometimes, you need to ensure data consistency across multiple browser windows or synchronize page data to the latest state when a user's computer resumes from sleep mode. Using `refreshOnWindowFocus` can save you a lot of logic code. [Click here to go to the document](https://www.attojs.com/guide/documentation/refreshOnWindowFocus.html)

```ts
const { data, error, run } = useRequest(getUserInfo, {
  refreshOnWindowFocus: true,
  refocusTimespan: 1000, // refresh interval 1s
});
```

### 2.Polling Data

Sometimes, you need to ensure data synchronization across multiple devices. In this case, you can use `pollingInterval` provided by us to periodically re-request the API, ensuring data consistency across multiple devices. When a user modifies the data, the changes will be synced in real-time between two windows. [Click here to go to the document](https://www.attojs.com/guide/documentation/polling.html)

```ts
const { data, error, run } = useRequest(getUserInfo, {
  pollingInterval: 1000, // polling interval 1s
});
```
